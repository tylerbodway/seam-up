# The Thesis

AI agentic coding compresses the gap between thinking and building. One person with AI can cover a lot more ground without losing the thread. If you've worked this way, you know the feeling: building moves fast enough that tight collaboration _during_ implementation is less valuable than it used to be, and can slow things down.

This changes what collaboration is for.

The old model assumed construction was the bottleneck. Break the project into tasks, distribute them, co-construct. That made sense when building was slow and expensive. But when one builder with AI can carry a meaningful vertical slice from spec to shipped code, construction isn't the bottleneck anymore. Understanding is. Agreeing on what to build, where one person's work ends and another's begins, and what holds them together.

## The origin

Seam Up is an evolution of [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup). The name is a direct play on it. Where Shape Up focuses on shaping the _work_, Seam Up emphasizes the _seams_: the boundaries and interfaces where builders' work joins together.

Shape Up got something fundamentally right: the highest-leverage activity isn't building, it's shaping. Shape well and building goes smoothly. Seam Up extends that insight for AI-augmented builders who can individually hold larger scopes. When each builder can carry more, the seams between their work become the thing most worth shaping carefully.

This isn't a criticism of Shape Up. Shape Up was designed for a context where collaboration during construction was valuable and necessary. That context is shifting. Seam Up picks up where Shape Up's building phase begins and asks: if builders can now move faster and more independently, what's the best use of the team's collaborative energy?

The answer is the seams.

## The claim

AI doesn't eliminate the need for collaboration. It moves where collaboration is most valuable, away from co-construction and toward co-design of boundaries and agreements.

In Shape Up, you shape the work. In Seam Up, the most important thing you shape is the space _between_ builders.

The rest of this book unpacks that claim: what it means in practice, the tensions that motivate it, and the principles and techniques that make it work.
