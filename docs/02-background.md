# Background

Seam Up builds on Shape Up and responds to a shift introduced by AI agentic coding. Here's what it inherits and what changed.

## What's inherited?

[Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) is Basecamp's methodology for product development. Seam Up carries forward its core concepts:

- **Shaping**: Defining the problem and solution at the right level of abstraction _before_ building. Shaped work is rough enough to leave room for builders, concrete enough to show the boundaries.
- **Appetite**: Fixed time, variable scope. Instead of asking "how long will this take?", you ask "how much time are we willing to spend?" The appetite constrains the solution.
- **Vertical slicing**: Completing meaningful end-to-end slices rather than building layer by layer. A vertical slice touches every layer of the stack and delivers something a user can see or use.
- **Scope hammering**: Aggressively cutting scope to fit the appetite. If a feature doesn't fit, you cut the feature, not the deadline.
- **Cutting scope**: Saying no to things that don't fit. Related to scope hammering but broader: some things simply don't make the cut for this cycle.

These ideas are good. Seam Up doesn't replace them. It extends them into territory Shape Up doesn't cover in depth: what happens when builders are augmented by AI and can each carry significantly more scope on their own.

## What's changed?

AI agentic coding compresses the gap between thinking and building. A workflow that used to span multiple people and days can now happen within a single builder's session: take a product spec, distill it into an engineering spec, work through design decisions, produce a task plan, and start building, all in one coherent thread.

This isn't rigid spec-driven development. The planning phase produces a rough plan, but implementation is adaptive. The point is that one person with AI can cover more ground and maintain coherence across a larger surface area than was previously practical.

That changes what collaboration is for. When a single builder can carry a full vertical slice with high coherence, the collaborative energy that used to go into co-construction is better spent _before_ construction: agreeing on boundaries, defining scope agreements, and splitting work cleanly.

### Team assumptions

Seam Up isn't for every team. It assumes a few things:

- **Ownership means both accountability and autonomy.** Each builder is responsible for quality and delivery within their scope, and decides how to approach problems within it. That doesn't mean working in isolation. Collaborative feedback is welcome and valuable. But each builder should feel autonomous in how they draft and execute their solution.
- **Work division is flexible.** Sometimes builders take vertical slices (each person owns a feature end-to-end). Sometimes it's horizontal layers (frontend vs. backend). The methodology works with both, but favors vertical slices where possible.
- **Communication is mixed.** Async for updates and reviews (written artifacts, PRs). Sync for decisions and kickoffs. Seam Up doesn't prescribe a single communication mode.
- **AI workflows can be personal.** Of course we share what works, learn from others, contribute and utilize shared tooling, but there's no expectation that we work the same. We're still human. AI workflows should enable your problem solving to produce the best solutions. We're all growing and experimenting in this new landscape. Seam Up defines a collaborative framework for the team and leaves the specifics of each person's AI workflow to them.

If your team already values builder autonomy and is exploring AI-augmented workflows, Seam Up gives you a structure for keeping collaboration valuable without making it a bottleneck.
